Filename : Makefile_notes.txt
=============================


The make utility will be able to determine the location within which the following files should
reside.

It does this by referring to the appropriate (%.png) vpath directive above.

Note that the full relative path and filename is specified for each of the following files. If
however, just the filename was specified, then an appropriate vpath directive would need to be set
above in order to tell the make utility where to find the files.


If a Makefile contains both implicit and static Pattern rules, it will cause make to issue the
following warning;

  *** mixed implicit and static pattern rules.  Stop.
