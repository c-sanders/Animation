=================================


The videos sub-directory of this package uses the ffmpeg utility to create its videos.

Some of the ffmpeg options which are used to create these videos are explained below.


ffmpeg options
--------------

-y

Overwrite output files

-r

Output frame rate

-loop 1


-pix_fmt yuv444p

Generate the output video using the H264 standard.

# -f concat : This argument instructs ffmpeg to concatenate together all of the files which are
#             listed in the file which is passed as an argument to -i.


# -s ${RESOLUTION_ANIMATION}


Notes
-----

Note 1)

The files which are to be used by this command, must start with a sequence number of 1, i.e. 000001
in this case. If they don't, then ffmpeg will complain with the following error;

  Could find no file with path 'Eulers_formula_%06d.png' and index in the range 0-4
  Eulers_formula_%06d.png: No such file or directory


Note 2)

This rule doesn't have any dependencies. This was done on purpose, as doing so means the rule
doesn't need to concern itself with them. Rather, it lets the appropriate Makefile target in
../slides deal with any dependencies instead.
