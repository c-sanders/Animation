	\frametitle{Description of the plot}

	In a moment, we will see an animation which depicts how Euler's formula progresses as \(\theta\) increases in value.\\~

	In this animation;

	\begin{itemize}
		\item   The red plot represents the first component, that is \(cos(\theta)\)
		\item   The blue plot represents the second component, that is \(jsin(\theta)\)
		\item   The green plot represents the addition of these two components, that is \(e^{j\theta}\)
	\end{itemize}
