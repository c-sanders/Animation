	\frametitle{Plotting Euler's formula}

	We can plot Euler's formula as a 3D graph, using \(\theta\) as the independent variable. If we do this, then;

	\begin{itemize}
		\item   The first component \(cos(\theta)\), will reside in the 2D plane~:~\(\theta\)-Real
		\item   The second component \(jsin(\theta)\), will reside in the 2D plane~:~\(\theta\)-Imaginary.
		\item   The result of adding the two components together \(e^{j\theta}\), will reside in the \\
				3D space : \(\theta\)-Real-Imaginary
	\end{itemize}

	Note that the two components will be plotted in planes, while the result of adding them together will be plotted in space.
